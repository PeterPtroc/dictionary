# dictionary

## introduction

this is a program that records words and their meanings, and also tests whether you have remembered them.

however, I am a noob in C, and there must be many bugs in my code. Forgive me please...

## targets

- [ ] make the program save the words to a file when it closes, and automatically load the file when it opens again.
- [ ] use fget() instead of scanf()

~buttttttttt I'm lazy, and I may not be able to finish.~
